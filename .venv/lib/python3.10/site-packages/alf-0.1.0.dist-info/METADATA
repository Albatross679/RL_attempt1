              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

[![CI](https://github.com/HorizonRobotics/alf/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg?branch=pytorch)](https://github.com/HorizonRobotics/alf/actions/workflows/test.yml)

Agent Learning Framework (ALF) is a reinforcement learning framework emphasizing on the flexibility and easiness of implementing complex algorithms involving many different components. ALF is built on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). The development of [previous version](https://github.com/HorizonRobotics/alf/tree/tensorflow) based on [Tensorflow 2.1](https://www.tensorflow.org/) has stopped as of Feb 2020.

## Tutorial
A draft tutorial can be accessed on [RTD](https://alf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html). This tutorial is still under
construction and some chapters are unfinished yet.

## Installation

#### OS software
The following installation has been tested on Ubuntu22.04 and Ubuntu24.04 with CUDA 11.8.

Python3.10-3.12 is currently supported by ALF. Note that some pip packages (e.g., pybullet) need python dev files, so make sure the corresponding python3-dev package is installed:

```
sudo apt install -y python3.11 python3.11-dev
```

We also require the following packages: 
```
sudo apt install libboost-all-dev   # required by ALF for fast parallel environments.
sudo apt install ninja-build        # required to build modules via torch.utils.cpp_extension
sudo apt install swig               # required to build box2d-py
sudo apt install xvfb               # for running headless training jobs locally
```

#### Python environment
[Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) is recommended for the installation. After creating and activating a virtual env, you can run the following commands to install ALF:

```
git clone https://github.com/HorizonRobotics/alf
cd alf
```

#### Using uv (no manual venv needed)
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) can manage an isolated environment for ALF without creating a virtualenv yourself. A typical workflow looks like this:

1. Install uv (once per machine):
   ```bash
   curl -Ls https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```
   Restart your shell or source the profile snippet the installer prints.

2. Bootstrap the project environment (creates `.venv/` and `uv.lock` automatically):
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. Launch Python inside that environment:
   ```bash
   uv run python
   ```
   Any command prefixed with `uv run` uses the synced environment, e.g. `uv run python -m alf.bin.train --conf=...`.

4. Add or update packages:
   ```bash
   uv add some-package
   uv add pandas==2.2.3
   ```
   uv records the changes in `pyproject.toml` and regenerates `uv.lock`.

5. Remove packages when they are no longer needed:
   ```bash
   uv remove some-package
   ```

6. To refresh dependencies after editing `pyproject.toml` by hand, rerun `uv sync`.

7. Commit dependency changes (keep `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` in version control):
   ```bash
   git add pyproject.toml uv.lock
   git commit -m "Update dependencies"
   git push origin <your-branch>
   ```

Everything stays local to the repository; no system-wide packages or pre-existing virtualenv are required.

#### Alternatively, for manual pip install, w/o uv:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

#### For Nix Users

There is a built-in Nix-based development environment defined in [flake.nix](./flake.nix). To activate it, run

```bash
$ nix develop
```

in the root of your local repository.

## Docker
We also provide a docker image of ALF for convenience. In order to use this image, you need to have [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) (for ALF gpu usage) installed first.

```bash
docker run --gpus all -it horizonrobotics/cuda:11.8.0-py3.11-torch2.2-ubuntu22.04 /bin/bash
```
This will give you a shell that have all ALF and dependencies pre-installed.

The current docker image contains an ALF version on Feb 21, 2024. Regular version updates are expected in the future.

## Examples

You can train any `_conf.py` file under `alf/examples` as follows:
```bash
python -m alf.bin.train --conf=CONF_FILE --root_dir=LOG_DIR
```
* CONF_FILE is the path to your conf file which follows ALF configuration file format (basically python).
* LOG_DIR is the directory when you want to store the training results. Note that if you want to train from scratch, LOG_DIR must point to a location that doesn't exist. Otherwise, it is assumed to resume the training from a previous checkpoint (if any).

During training, we use tensorboard to show the progress of training:
```bash
tensorboard --logdir=LOG_DIR
```

After training, you can evaluate the trained model and visualize environment
frames using the following command:
```bash
python -m alf.bin.play --root_dir=LOG_DIR
```

To launch single-node multi-gpu training, set the 'multi-gpu' argument
```bash
python -m alf.bin.train --conf=CONF_FILE --root_dir=LOG_DIR --distributed multi-gpu
```

To launch multi-node multi-gpu training, we use torch distributed launch module. The 'local_rank' for each process can be obtained from 'PerProcessContext' class, which can be used to assign gpu for your environment if you wish. For details on how PyTorch assign 'local_rank' and 'ddp_rank', please refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/torch/distributed/launch.py).  To start training, run the following command on the host machine:
```bash
export NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME=SOCKET # find in ifconfig
export NCCL_IB_DISABLE=1

torchrun \
    --nproc_per_node=NGPU_ON_NODE \
    --nnodes=NUMBER_OF_NODES \
    --node_rank=NODE_RANK \
    --master_addr=HOST_IP \
    --master_port=12345 \
    ./alf/bin/train.py \
    --conf=CONF_FILE \
    --root_dir=LOG_DIR \
    --distributed multi-node-multi-gpu \
```
and simultaneously run the same command on each worker machine. For each worker machine, assign a NODE_RANK to it and update NGPU_ON_NODE if the number of GPUs is different from the host. Please make sure that all machines get a same copy of the codebase.

#### **Deprecated**

An older version of ALF used [gin](https://github.com/google/gin-config)
for job configuration. Its syntax is not as flexible as ALF conf (e.g., you can't easily
do math computation in a gin file). There are still some examples with `.gin`
under `alf/examples`. We are in the process of converting all `.gin` examples to `_conf.py`
examples.

You can train any `.gin` file under `alf/examples` using the following command:
```bash
cd alf/examples; python -m alf.bin.train --gin_file=GIN_FILE --root_dir=LOG_DIR
```
* GIN_FILE is the path to the gin conf (some `.gin` files under `alf/examples` might be invalid; they have not been converted to use the latest pytorch version of ALF).
* LOG_DIR has the same meaning as in the ALF conf example above.

*Warning*: When using **gin**, ALF has to be launched in the same directory with the gin file(s). If an error says that no configuration file is found, then probably you've launched ALF in a wrong place.

All the examples below are trained on a single machine Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-7960X CPU @ 2.80GHz with 32 CPUs and one RTX 2080Ti GPU.

* [MetaDrive](alf/examples/metadrive/ppg_metadrive_conf.py). Learning to drive on randomly generated map with interaction on the [MetaDrive](https://metadriverse.github.io/metadrive/) simulator, with BEV as input. Need to install python package [metadrive-simulator](https://github.com/metadriverse/metadrive).

### DDPG
* [FetchSlide (sparse rewards)](alf/examples/ddpg_fetchslide_conf.py). Need to install the [MuJoCo](https://www.roboti.us/index.html) simulator first. This example reproduces the performance of vanilla DDPG reported in the OpenAI's Robotics environment [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09464.pdf). Our implementation doesn't use MPI, but obtains (evaluation) performance on par with the original implementation. (*The original MPI implementation has 19 workers, each worker containing 2 environments for rollout and sampling a minibatch of size 256 from its replay buffer for computing gradients. All the workers' gradients will be summed together for a centralized optimizer step. Our implementation simply samples a minibatch of size 5000 from a common replay buffer per optimizer step.*) The training took about 1 hour with 38 (19*2) parallel environments on a single GPU.

* [FetchReach (sparse rewards)](alf/examples/sac_fetchreach.gin). Need to install the [MuJoCo](https://www.roboti.us/index.html) simulator first. The training took about 20 minutes with 20 parallel environments on a single GPU.

  <img src="alf/examples/sac_fetchreach.png" width="300" height="200" alt="sac-fetchreach-training-curve"/> <img src="alf/examples/sac_fetchreach.gif" width="300" height="200" alf="sac-fetchreach-video"/>

* [FetchSlide (sparse rewards)](alf/examples/sac_fetchslide.gin). Need to install the [MuJoCo](https://www.roboti.us/index.html) simulator first. This is the same task with the DDPG example above, but with SAC as the learning algorithm.
Also it has only 20 (instead of 38) parallel environments to improve sample efficiency. The training took about 2 hours on a single GPU.

  <img src="alf/examples/sac_fetchslide.png" width="300" height="200" alt="sac-fetchslide-training-curve"/> <img src="alf/examples/sac_fetchslide.gif" width="300" height="200" alf="sac-fetchslide-video"/>

* [Fetch Environments (sparse rewards) w/ Action Repeat](alf/examples/sac_actrepeat_fetch/sac_actrepeat_fetch.gin). We are able to achieve even better performance than reported by DDPG + Hindsight Experience Replay in some cases simply by using SAC + Action Repeat with length 3 timesteps. See [this note](docs/notes/fetch_env_sac_actrepeat_notes.rst) to view learning curves, videos, and more details.

### ICM
* [Super Mario](alf/examples/icm_super_mario_intrinsic_only.gin). Playing Super Mario only using intrinsic reward.
  Python package gym-retro>=0.7.0 is required for this experiment and also a suitable `SuperMarioBros-Nes` rom should be obtained and imported (roms are not included in gym-retro). See [this doc](https://retro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#importing-roms) on how to import roms.

### RND
* [Montezuma's Revenge](alf/examples/ppo_rnd_mrevenge.gin). Training the hard exploration game Montezuma's Revenge with intrinsic rewards generated by [RND](alf/algorithms/rnd_algorithm.py). A lucky agent can get an episodic score of 6600 in 160M frames (40M steps with `frame_skip=4`). A normal agent would get an episodic score of 4000~6000 in the same number of frames. The training took about 6.5 hours with 128 parallel environments on a single GPU.
